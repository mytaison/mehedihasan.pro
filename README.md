This is my portfolio website, actually you can say an expertiment test subject. Whatever I find interesting, I like to implement it here if I find any scope. Current Version is a NextJS project.

## Design

I love to work with Neuomorphism. I had long time plan to build entire application using neumorphism design. So here it is. At last I got some time to do it. Fully unique, you will not get it anywhere. :D

## Live Site

Live site: [mehedihasan.pro](https://mehedihasan.pro/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
